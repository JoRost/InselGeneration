# Simple 2D Map Generation Project in Unity
By using noise maps generate random islands for games. 


# Current State
![Map using {373.4,0.05,1} and {56,0.01,0.3}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e61d3c-6965-4736-8cfb-ec59d6d6f5f6)
Map using {373.4,0.05,1} and {56,0.01,0.3} as the Height Map

# Next Plans
- Improve noise maps to use additional Features
- Simple Character controller to explore maps
- Ruletiles so the maps look good
- Layers to generate the Map step by stem and enable houses and trees
